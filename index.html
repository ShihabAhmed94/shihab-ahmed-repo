        <P>Knowing how to write a paragraph is incredibly important. It’s a basic aspect of writing, and it is something that everyone should know how to do. There is a specific structure that you have to follow when you’re writing a paragraph. This structure helps make it easier for the reader to understand what is going on. Through writing good paragraphs, a person can communicate a lot better through their writing.</P>
